Whale bot documentation
-----------------------

The goal of whale bot is recognize and catagorize whales using a convoluted nueral network.

The current bot is used to scrape reddit and comment on posts containing pictures of whales though I intend on expanding into a mobile application that can be taken on whale watching trips and to be used for research and tracking purposes.

======
To Do:
======

- Fully implement logging for bot.
- Improve the accuracy of the nueral network.
